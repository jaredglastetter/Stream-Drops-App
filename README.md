# Stream Drops App

# How It Works

This app has two user flows depending on the user type (Streamer and Viewer).

# Streamer

If you have an affiliate account on Twitch, you'll have access to the streamer dashboard where you can create Channel Point rewards using the create reward option. When you create a reward, an NFT model is generated through Niftory, which is then set up for redemption on Twitch. This means that you can use the NFT as a unique reward for your viewers, allowing them to redeem it in exchange for Channel Points. By minting the NFT, you create a rare and valuable asset that can be used to incentivize your audience and create a sense of exclusivity around your stream.

# Viewer

If you have a regular Twitch account, you can access the user dashboard where you can view the rewards you've redeemed on Twitch. One type of reward is Stream Drops, which are earned by watching certain streams and can be redeemed for various prizes. When you redeem a Stream Drops reward on a Twitch stream, our backend processes the redemption event from Twitch and creates an NFT for the reward. You'll receive a prompt to view your reward on streamdrops.xyz, a platform that allows you to manage and view your redeemed rewards.

By signing up for Stream Drops, you'll have access to the rewards you've redeemed on Twitch and can explore other streamers who use Stream Drops to offer web3 rewards. This provides a new way to engage with your favorite streamers and earn unique rewards that have real-world value. The platform also allows you to easily manage and track your rewards, making it a convenient and user-friendly experience.
